# Agent-Test

Agent test is a react application that allows you to take online tests to become a certified insurance agent according to the Greek laws.

In the /assets directory you'll find an excel file and a JSON file. Using the /parse.js file, you can parse the excel file to generate the JSON that contains the Q/As.

You can use this repository as a template and just supply a different answers.json to create an online test-taking website. Keep in mind that the answers are not secured and can be easily viewed by the end user.
